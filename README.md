# Foresight

Fire Foresight is a machine learning–based project designed to predict and assess fire risk using data-driven methods. The system combines a trained predictive model with an interactive web interface, enabling users to explore fire risk insights efficiently and intuitively.

# Model

The core of the project is a trained machine learning model hosted on Hugging Face.
It processes input features and outputs predictions related to fire risk likelihood.

# Interface

An interactive web interface allows users to test the model without technical setup.
Users can input data, run predictions, and immediately view results.
